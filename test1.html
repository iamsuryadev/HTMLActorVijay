        The quark model. The Ω–. The cosmic microwave background. Charm. The Brout–Englert–Higgs mechanism. CP violation. Colour. 1964 was a remarkable year for invention and discovery. In 2025, the community has the opportunity to shape strategic investments for decades to come. CERN Council president Costas Fountas and strategy secretary Karl Jakobs report a growing consensus on the future of the field. Elsewhere in these pages: as its final chapter begins, John Ellis tells the story of quarkonia; should dark energy evolve?; scalable technology for precision neutrino physics with small detectors; careers advice from IBM’s head of science and technology; an update on the ATOMKI anomaly; Andreas Hoecker’s highlights from EPS–HEP; how data preservation can unearth hidden treasures; and much more.
